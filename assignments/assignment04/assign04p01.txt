Assignment 4 Problem 1

using this struct:

  typedef struct node {
    int data;
    struct node *left;
    struct node *right;
  } node;

/* root is the root of a tree and ptrNode is the node who's level is to be obtained */
int getLevel(node *root, node *ptrNode) {
  if (root == NULL || ptrNode == NULL)
    return -1;

  /* found ptrNode so return 0 since it is on this level */
  if (root == ptrNode)
    return 0;

  /* only >= 0 if ptrNode was found further down than root */
  int left = getLevel(root->left, ptrNode);
  if (left >= 0)
    /* add 1 since it is found 1 subtree down from root */
    return left + 1;

  int right = getLevel(root->right, ptrNode);
  if (right >= 0)
    return right + 1;

  return -1;
